# ACE_VR


Hi I'm Charles, I'm really passionate about competitive shooting and training.
Since ive discovered ACE, it's been a game changer for my dry fire practice and improving my visual focus. I absolutely love the product and the great community around it. 

I'm excited to contribute by creating handsets that match the actual firearms used by shooters, making them compatible with the ACE FCU. I'm not a pro, just a hobbyist who loves to tinker. 

I'll be sharing STL files for handsets and other ACE-compatible printables right here. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out—my contact info is on my GitHub profile. 

I'm not officially affiliated with ACE or any of the manufacturers I've drawn inspiration from. Please remember, these STLs are for personal use only and should not be sold. Let's have fun and keep improving together!
